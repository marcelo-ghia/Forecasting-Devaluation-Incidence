# Forecasting-Devaluation-Incidence

This project aims to forecast devaluation events in Latin American
countries using Google Trends data in order to analyse a decision-making
problem. The study employs panel data extracted from Google Trends,
including keywords related to economic crisis, default, devaluation, dollar
price, inflation, and exchange rate. The data consists of the quantity of
searches on a weekly basis for these keywords in nine different countries
in Latin America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay,
Peru, and Uruguay). Additionally, the currency price in terms of USD is
extracted for each week and the percentage variation in the price is calculated.
A cutoff of 7.5% is used to identify ”jump devaluations” exceeding
the cutoff.
